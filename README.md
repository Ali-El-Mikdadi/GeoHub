# Starting from What You Have
GeoHub Web Application should be transformed into a free and open-source system based on the wishes of its founders, which was initially created as a project for a course labeled ITCS 333 Internet and Web development course. The system has been built and written to a certain extent, and it is now time to properly package the code so that it may run on any computing platform.
