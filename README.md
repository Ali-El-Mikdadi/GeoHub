This is an OpenSource Web Application for <a href="https://geohub.great-site.net/ITCS333-Project/mainpage.php">LINK</a>

> The system that we will construct is open source and free, which means that users can download it in its entirety, including the code.
> The system is a website for quizzes creation and conduction.
> Users can create a  quiz or conduct one on the website.

# The project is Free & Open-Source
Open-source Quizzes-based website where everyone may engage and design their own quiz.
This system is free open-source software that was created under the provisions of the MIT License. Everyone is welcome to participate.

# But first look around 
There are numerous projects that are comparable to ours. However, as we progress in our mission, we will undoubtedly work on more and new things that are not available on such sites, and this is what will distinguish us as the best.

# Starting from What You Have
GeoHub Web Application should be transformed into a free and open-source system based on the wishes of its founders, which was initially created as a project for a course labeled ITCS 333 Internet and Web development course. The system has been built and written to a certain extent, and it is now time to properly package the code so that it may run on any computing platform.
