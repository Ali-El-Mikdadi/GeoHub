# The project is Free & Open-Source
Open-source Quizzes-based website where everyone may engage and design their own quiz.
This system is free open-source software that was created under the provisions of the MIT License. Everyone is welcome to participate.

# Looking around Other Similar Projects
There are numerous projects that are comparable to ours. However, as we progress in our mission, we will undoubtedly work on more and new things that are not available on such sites, and this is what will distinguish us as the best.
 
# Choosing a Good Name

# Starting from What You Have
GeoHub Web Application should be transformed into a free and open-source system based on the wishes of its founders, which was initially created as a project for a course labeled ITCS 333 Internet and Web development course. The system has been built and written to a certain extent, and it is now time to properly package the code so that it may run on any computing platform.
